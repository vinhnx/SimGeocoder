SimGeocoder
===========

Use the Google Maps API to geocode an address and set the iOS Simulator 
to use the resulting coordinates.

Requirements
------------

You must be running [Location Helper](http://www.mousedown.net/mouseware/LocationHelper.html) 
(free from the App Store [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/location-helper-for-applescript/id488536386?mt=12)).

You must have GUI scripting enabled. SimGeocoder will tell you how to do this 
when it first runs, if necessary.

How to Use
----------

1. Double-click the SimGeocoder app.
2. Enter an address or placename just like you would in Google Maps.
3. There is no step 3.

just open the `.app` in Script Editor--it's just AppleScript.
